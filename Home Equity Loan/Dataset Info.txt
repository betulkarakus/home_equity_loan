Credit Estimation AI/ML Classification Model
HMEQ (Home Equity Loan) Dataset

A consumer credit department of a bank aims to automate the decision-making process for approving "home equity loan limits." The model will be built using data collected from applicants who have been granted credit through the existing credit commitment process. The model will be constructed using predictive modeling tools; however, the resulting model should be interpretable enough to provide reasons for any negative actions (such as rejection).
